**Intro**

This single page web app was created as the second project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. 
This file contains the process by which this web app was created over the course of 4 days. 

**Use Case**
This app is intended to be used to track awards, attendances, and other player records for Amtgard International. It currently allows users to sign up, sign in, change their password, sign out, add awards, view awards, edit awards, and remove awards. 

**Pre-Planning**
After the assignment was given, I drew up an ERD for the API 

**ERD**

Users -|---< Awards

**Day 1**
On day 1 of the project, I worked on setting up my API as well as getting the initial client application deployed, despite it being blank. See the ork-api README.md for more information about what happened on day 1 of the project week. 

**Day 2**
On day 2 of the project, I began setting up the authorization functionality and was able to finish all of it and begin linking the client app to the API. After that was done, I began setting up the functionality of adding personas, awards, and attendances. I was informed that I didn't need to use personas and could just use users instead, but I was unable to display all users with all of the awards and attendance attached to them. After some backtracking and database rollbacks, I was able to get most of the issue sorted out and began preparing to build the functionality the next day.

**Day 3**
On day 3 of the project, began working on the functionality to add and view awards. I was able to finish both of them and moved on to building the delete functionality by setting up the buttons in handlebars, but that is as far as I was able to progress during the workshop time. 

**Day 4**
On the final day of the project, I spent my time finishing up the functionality of the app. The edit and remove functions still had to be set up and tested. As well as all of the styling. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get to the styling during the project week, but the functionality was there. 

**Materials Used**
For this project I used Visual Studios Code, Google Fonts, html, CSS,  JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Handlebars.

**Moving Forward**
Going forward I would like to add functionality to add attendances, parks, kingdoms, and principalities. All users will be able to upload a picture of themselves for all others to see. Styling is also something I would like to get to, but the stylng is less important for this use.
